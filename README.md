# ORACsolns
ORAC solns in python
This is the site with all the problems:
https://orac2.info/hub/

Im going to organise this into the sets and then start uploading my solutions

This is being done in 2025 so all solutions read and write to console now (except for specific problems from selection exam sets but those will be dealt with later)

I'm uploading a lot of these as I solve them, and I am quite hesitant to upload problems unless the set they originate from has already been solved

✅ for completed
❌ for uncompleted

# Editorials
I will be writing my own editorials for certain COMPLETED problemsets, these will be uploaded as pdfs, mostly as practise for my explanation skills

# Completed Problems
Heres a table of every problem I have **uploaded**. These are numbered based on the hyperlink they have on ORAC, which comes in the form https://orac2.info/problem/`X`/ where `X` is the problem number. I'll also include the score I achieved on that problem incase I upload a partial solution.

| Problem #  | Problem Name | Score /100 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 3  | Vases  | 100 |
